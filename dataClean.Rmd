Load training data into house

Let's examine our data for predictors with large number of NA values

```{r}
house = read.csv('train.csv')
nacols = colMeans(is.na(house))>.1
housenacols = colMeans(is.na(house[nacols]))
barplot(housenacols)
```

There are some features with large amount of NA values. We will remove features with greater than 0.40 NA values.

```{r}
df = house[, !names(house) %in% names(housenacols > 0.4)]
```

```{r}
df$Id = NULL
```

```{r}
#df[df %in% "TA"] = 3
#df$BsmtCond[df$BsmtCond == "TA"] = "3"
#as.data.frame(sapply(df, function(x) gsub("TA", "3", x)))
#df = gsub("TA", "5", df)
```


cor(df)
